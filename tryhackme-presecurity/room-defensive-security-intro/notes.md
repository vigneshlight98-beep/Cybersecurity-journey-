🔍 What I learned
- I got a basic idea of what blue team is all about, what are all the proactive measures that a company take to proctect their website/application.
  

🛡️ Blue-Team Responsibilities (my understanding)
- Initially they do monitering and detecting(continuous observation)
- Then the Incident response(they come in when the alrets are raised)
- Threat intelligence(Gathering and using inforamtion about hackers)
- Vulnerability management(fixing flaws in order to lower the risk)
- Investigation and analysis(solving a puzzle to uncover valuable insights)
