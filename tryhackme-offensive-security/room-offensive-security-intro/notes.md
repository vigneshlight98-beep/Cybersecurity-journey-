## 🔍 What I learned
- How to hack a bank via its webisite using dirb and add money to my account.

## 🧠 Concepts explained in my own words
- Dirb → reads words from common.txt → tries them on the website → shows you the ones that exist.
- common.txt consisits of many words it just ties to match it with the hidded words of the website, after finding it, I have to copy paste the URL in the website and it will take me to the hidden page there I will put my account number and the amount I want to loot.

## 🧪 Techniques / Tools used (example: Burp Suite, browser dev tools)
- Dirb is the tool used here
